                <br>
                <p>I'm a filmmaker who finds joy in capturing moments and telling stories through the lens. Join me on this cinematic journey as I share my experiences, insights, and the art of filmmaking.</p>
                <br>
            
                <h2>My Filmmaking Journey</h2>
                <br>
                <p><b>Early Inspirations</b>
                    <br>
                    From the first time I held a camera, I knew filmmaking was my calling. Early influences from classic films to contemporary masterpieces have shaped my creative vision.
                    <br>
                    <b>First Projects
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    Every filmmaker has to start somewhere. I started making short films in 8th standard. But gradually with growing experience I improved more and more.from short films to experimental pieces, each contributing to my growth as a storyteller.</p>
                    <br>
            
                <h2>The Art of Filmmaking</h2>
                <br>
                <p><b>Cinematography</b>
                    <br>
                    It is the visual language of filmmaking. The way camera is held tells you alot about the current scene and in my opinion to make your audience lost inside your films, you should take care about it a lot.
                    <br>
                    <b>Editing</b>
                    <br>
                    I started editing in filmora. I had no knowledge about it. I just learnt by making mistakes and doing experiments. and I believe that the most important part of filmmaking is the editing.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
                <br>
                <p><b>Filmmaking Equipment</b>
                    <br>
                    Initially I don't had that much of proffesional equipments to create a very good film. but because of my dedication, I worked hard and after recognisation of this talent inside me, my parents gave me a tripod as a gift on my birthday and I really loved it a lot. Still I needs more professional equipments and I will keep on working hard to get them.
                    <br>
                    
                    <b>The Fun Behind the Camera</b>
                    <br>
                    creating a complete film is really a very exhausting process but since I have a lot of interest in it. So, I enjoys it alot and even after that much or tireness, I love doing this.</p>
